### LevelSet Solutions (Royal Oak, MI)

**Director of Technology** (March 2015 - July 2017)  
**Technical Development Lead** (October 2013 - March 2015)  
**Full Stack Developer** (December 2010 - October 2013)  

- First developer to join the company
- Initially focused on .NET (C#) rewrite of a large enterprise web application
- Solely responsible for all aspects of development until additional developer was hired
- **Promoted to Technical Development Lead in October 2013**
- Hired people for their values and desire to learn, more so than their current technical skills. This resulted in a team of highly motivated, highly collaborative developers who were constantly looking to improve themselves and their peers.
- Emphasized the importance of a collaborative development experience. By moving all of our code to Github, we were able to introduce standards for referential commit messages and a streamlined code review processes that kept the experience tidy for both developers and business analysts. I introduced Slack and an open-source internal wiki that we used for documentation, and cultivated a culture of openness and and curiosity.
- Went all-in on Amazon Web Services and Infrastructure As Code, which allowed us to rapidly deploy environments that were fully redundant and version-controlled.
- Shifted our focus away from .NET and onto technology that was linux-friendly (PHP, Ruby, Node, etc). Through the use of open source tools and frameworks, we were able to script large portions of our workflows that greatly reduced the amount of manual effort in development and deployment.
- Dedicated a large portion of my time to mentoring both junior and senior developers, not only in best development practices, but also in being a good colleague.
- Established a weekly technology meeting with a rotating presentation schedule between each developer to encourage open discussions and collaboration.
- Emphasized the importance of doing things the right way. Code smells were made to be an important part of our development process, and when something didnâ€™t smell right, we always discussed why and what could be done to make it better.
- **Promoted to Director of Technology in March 2015**
- Fully responsible for re-architecture and migration of multiple enterprise applications to the cloud. In total, hosting infrastructure consisted of 45+ servers between 6 virtual private networks, all implemented with load balancing, automatic failovers, and distributed services.
- Implemented coding and architecture standards that revolved around stateless services. At the infrastructure level, services were broken up by domain and decoupled for reusability between systems. At the code level, stateless single-purpose service objects were the primary drivers of functionality. This resulted in a significantly cleaner codebase with highly reusable components.
- Researched and tested several Infrastructure as Code technologies to replace our home-grown solution built several years prior. Converted all of our hosted applications to use Chef and AWS Opsworks for provisioning/deployment.
- Significantly increased automated test coverage (both front and back-end) which allowed us to safely implement continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- Completed EOS training, which provides a framework for maximizing the effectiveness of time and decisions in a leadership capacity.  
- Increased emphasis on career development for my team, defining personal goals with each individual and creating paths within the company for them to grow.

## Education

**Certificate, Technical and Professional Communication**; Lawrence Technological University (Southfield, MI)  
2010-2011

**BSc, Computer Science**; Lawrence Technological University (Southfield, MI)  
2005-2010


## Programming Languages/Frameworks

- **Ruby:** My pride and joy. I have a deep passion for the expressiveness that ruby provides and the community that surrounds it. Most of my large-scale web applications are built Rails, though I have also built apps with Sinatra and Hanami (previously known as Lotus). If I need to script something in a pinch, you can bet it'll be a few lines of ruby!
- **PHP:** Prior to discovering ruby, PHP was my language of choice. I made little use of popular frameworks and instead spent a great deal of time trying to roll my own custom code. While I'm not a huge fan of the language itself, I do still appreciate it and recognize it as a valuable language, especially with PHP7. It will always hold a special place in my heart.
- **Javascript** The effort required to stay up-to-date with the latest and greatest in the Javascript world has prevented me from making it a primary language of mine, but I have used both Angular and React a fair amount. I prefer to focus on functional components that consume APIs rather the user interface. Node/Express are great, but I've often opted for rails for my APIs.
- **C#:** Honrable mention - I think .NET is extremely powerful and comprehensive, I just don't like developing on Windows. .NET Core is a step in the right direction, though!
- Basic knowledge of **Objective-C**, **Python**, **Elixer**, **Java**
