I've had the pleasure of working with some truly great individuals over the years. Here are what a few of them have said about me.

## Aaron Emerson
> Alec is one of the most talented, thoughtful, and diligent developers I’ve ever had the opportunity to work with. The 3 and a half years I spent working with Alec have been some of the most pleasurable and erudite years of my professional life. Not only is his technical range second to none, but he also managed several developers at once while working on very complicated projects across many stacks of technology. He setup our entire server infrastructure, wrote code, reviewed code, and brainstormed our entire workflow process. And did all brilliantly. Even with all of those responsibilities, he always found the time to assist those that needed help and would jump from project to project seamlessly. It’s hard to fully express the impact Alec had on me, but it was profound. He helped me to not only grow technically but also as a collaborator and teammate. Needless to say, Alec would be a valuable asset to any team and I would be thrilled to work with him again.


## Steve Swanson
> A true professional, all technology comes easily to Alec; all of it. No matter the tool, framework or tech, Alec can navigate them and make things happen. He leans to lifelong learning approach to his craft, always striving to find better tools and improve the technical delivery of solutions. Alec has led the build and delivery of large, enterprise-level solutions ensuring the technical solution was best-in-class regardless of the obstacles. Alec’s eagerness to bring new ideas and willingness to assist anyone are qualities that are priceless and in short supply. In over 30 years of building and delivering technology-based solutions, Alec is the best engineer I’ve worked with. I’ve come to count on him immensely and highly recommend him to any company.


## Patti Swanson
> Alec is a professional who knows how to deliver no matter the challenge. His exceptional technical talent coupled with impressive problem-solving skills helps him deliver no matter the project from large enterprise-level software to complex digital marketing solutions. He is always willing to help, is focused on results, and yet still finds time to explore new ideas and solutions. He is one that we came to depend on during the most challenging technical situations. Alec would be an outstanding addition to any team.


## Phil Vogt
> Alec possesses golden personal qualities that are valuable within his profession and beyond. I was his professor in history and philosophy courses, which are well beyond his areas of professional competence, and yet he still stands out in my memory as a consummate gentleman who loves a lively give-and-take but also manages to put everyone at ease. A team with Alec as a member will be more ambitious but will function more harmoniously.
